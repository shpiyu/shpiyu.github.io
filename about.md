### Highly motivated, eager learner, and jack of all trades.

After graduating with a computer engineering degree from Pune University in 2017, I joined [Xoriant](https://www.xoriant.com) where I got an opportunity to work with [Morgan Stanley](http://morganstanley.com) as a consultant. During my time at Morgan I primarily worked on angular front-end projects and Java web applications. At the middle of my career in MS they promoted agile practises a lot and I learned the benefits of agile early in my career. After working for a little over 2 years I decided to leave the role of consultant and join a company as a full time employee.

In October 2019, I joined [BlackRock](http://blackrock.com) as an analyst where I worked in the FutureAdvisor team, a robo-trading startup acquired by BlackRock. Experience of working at Morgan Stanley gave me a good understanding of the financial domain and the eagerness to learn new things helped me pick up an entirely new technology stack - Ruby on Rails. I also learned Kotlin & React and got experience of working with AWS cloud.Now I am a part of the SMA tech team in BlackRock, where we build new applications and maintain the existing suite of applications that support our Separately Managed Account (SMA) business. 

I strongly believe in this quote from Malala on education

> There are many problems, but I think there is a solution to all these problems; it's just one, and it's education.

To work towards the betterment of education and provisioning quality education to every child, I give my two cents by building applications for and supporting the technical team of an NGO called [UPAY](https://www.upay.org.in/).

When I am not working, I try to do many things - writing short horror stories on [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/eleo90/how_did_raja_lose_his_voice/), trying my hands on acrylic painting, and posting pictures of my home-cooked food on my [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/piyushranjan95/). I have also started playing chess lately and my goal this year is to cross the 2000-elo rating mark. Up for a game? Send me a challenge on [lichess](https://lichess.org/@/shpiyu). Not much into chess and just want to talk? Hereâ€™s my email address: [piyushranjan95@gmail.com](mailto:piyushranjan95@gmail.com)
