### Highly Motivated, Eager Learner

I am a Software Engineer, living in Mumbai and working at BlackRock. Here's my story:

After graduating with a degree in Computer Engineering from Pune University in 2017, I joined [Xoriant](https://www.xoriant.com), where I had the opportunity to work with [Morgan Stanley](http://morganstanley.com) as a consultant. During my time at Morgan Stanley, I worked as a full-stack engineer, building web applications using Angular and Java. After a little over two years, I decided to leave the consulting role and join a company as a full-time employee.

In October 2019, I joined [BlackRock](http://blackrock.com), working with the FutureAdvisor team—a robo-trading startup acquired by BlackRock. My experience at Morgan Stanley gave me a solid foundation in the financial domain, and my eagerness to learn helped me quickly adapt to a new technology stack: Ruby on Rails. I also picked up Kotlin and React, and gained experience working with AWS Cloud. At BlackRock, I've worked with multiple teams in the Wealth Management domain. These days, I primarily focus on building Java-based microservices and APIs for an application that is used to run portfolio analysis at scale.

In the past, I’ve supported the technical team of an NGO called [UPAY](https://www.upay.org.in/), which works to provide quality education to children from underserved communities across various states in India.

When I'm not working, I enjoy discovering cafes in Mumbai that serve the tastiest food. Want to get in touch? Here’s my email: [piyushranjan95@gmail.com](mailto:piyushranjan95@gmail.com)
